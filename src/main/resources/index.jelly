  This plugin adds Python support to Jenkins with some useful builders (standard Python builder, <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv" target="_blank">virtualenv</a> builder, ...) and the ability to use a Python axis in multi-configuration projects (for testing on multiple versions of Python).
